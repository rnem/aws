2. A company developed an application by using AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon DynamoDB. An external application puts objects into the company's S3 bucket and tags the objects with date and time. A Lambda function periodically pulls data from the company's S3 bucket based on date and time tags and inserts specific values into a DynamoDB table for further processing. The data includes personally identifiable information (Pll). The company must remove data that is older than 30 days from the S3 bucket and the DynamoDB table. Which solution will meet this requirement with the MOST operational efficiency?

    - A) Update the Lambda function to add a TTL S3 flag to S3 objects. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to expire objects that are older than 30 days by using the TTL S3 flag.
    - B) Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to expire objects that are older than 30 days. Update the Lambda function to add the TTL attribute in the DynamoDB table. Enable TTL on the DynamoDB table to expire entires that are older than 30 days based on the TTL attribute.
    - C) Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to expire objects that are older than 30 days and to add all prefixes to the S3 bucket. Update the Lambda function to delete entries that are older than 30 days.
    - D) Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to expire objects that are older than 30 days by using object tags. Update the Lambda function to delete entries that are older than 30 days.

4. A company is testing its incident response plan for compromised credentials. The company runs a database on an Amazon EC2 instance and stores the sensitive data-base credentials as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager. The secret has rotation configured with an AWS Lambda function that uses the generic rotation function template. The EC2 instance and the Lambda function are deployed in the same private subnet.

credentials. Use the Secrets Manager rotate-secret command in the AWS CLI to force the immediate rotation of the secret.
    - D) Add an internet gateway to the VPC. Create a NAT gateway in a public sub-net. Update the VPC route tables so that traffic from the Lambda function and traffic from the EC2 instance can reach the Secrets Manager public endpoint.

58. A company has a web-based application using Amazon CloudFront and running on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

    - B) Add an origin custom header. Set the viewer protocol policy to HTTPS only. Set the origin protocol policy to match viewer. Update the application to validate the CloudFront custom header.
    - C) Add an origin custom header. Set the viewer protocol policy to redirect HTTP to HTTPS. Set the origin protocol policy to HTTP only. Update the application to validate the CloudFront custom header.
    - D) Add an origin custom header. Set the viewer protocol policy to redirect HTTP to HTTPS. Set the origin protocol policy to HTTPS only. Update the application to validate the CloudFront custom header.

61. A security engineer configures Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) for all objects that are in an S3 bucket in the `us-east-1`. Region Some objects in this S3 bucket use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) for encryption at test. The security engineer creates a destination S3 bucket in the `us-west-2` Region. The destination S3 bucket is in the same AWS account as the source S3 bucket. The security engineer also creates a customer managed key in `us-west-2` to encrypt objects at rest in the destination S3 bucket. The replication configuration is set to use the key in `us-west-2` to encrypt objects in the destination S3 bucket. The security engineer has provided the S3 replication configuration with an IAM role to perform the replication in Amazon S3. After a day, the security engineer notices that no encrypted objects from the source S3 bucket are replicated to the destination S3 bucket. However, all the unencrypted objects are replicated. Which combination of steps should the security engineer take to remediate this issue? (Select THREE)

    - A) Change the replication configuration to use the key in `us-east-1` to encrypt the objects that are in the destination S3 bucket.
    - B) Grant the IAM role the kms. Encrypt permission for the key in `us-east-1` that encrypts source objects.
    - C) Grant the IAM role the `s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication` permission for objects that are in the source S3 bucket.
    - D) Grant the IAM role the `kms:Decrypt` permission for the key in `us-east-1` that encrypts source objects.
    - E) Change the key policy of the key in `us-east-1` to grant the kms. Decrypt permission to the security engineer's IAM account.
    - F) Grant the IAM role the `kms:Encrypt` permission for the key in `us-west-2` that encrypts objects that are in the destination S3 bucket.

62. A company uses an Amazon S3 bucket to store reports Management has mandated that all new objects stored in this bucket must be encrypted at rest using server-side encryption with a client-specified IAM Key Management Service (AWS KMS) CMK owned by the same account as the S3 bucket.

63. A Security Engineer is working with the development team to design a supply chain application that stores sensitive inventory data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The application will use an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) to encrypt the data on Amazon S3. The inventory data on Amazon S3 will be shared of vendors. All vendors will use AWS principals from their own AWS accounts to access the data on Amazon S3. The vendor list may change weekly, and the solution must support cross-account access. What is the MOST efficient way to manage access control for the KMS CMK7?

    - A) Use KMS grants to manage key access. Programmatically create and revoke grants to manage vendor access.
    - B) Use an IAM role to manage key access. Programmatically update the IAM role policies to manage vendor access.
    - C) Use KMS key policies to manage key access. Programmatically update the KMS key policies to manage vendor access.
    - D) Use delegated access across AWS accounts by using IAM roles to manage key access. Programmatically update the IAM trust policy to manage cross- account vendor access.
