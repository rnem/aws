1. A company has an AWS Lambda function that creates image thumbnails from larger images. The Lambda function needs read and write access to an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS account.
Which solutions will provide the Lambda function this access? (Choose two.)

    - A. Create an IAM user that has only programmatic access. Create a new access key pair. Add environmental variables to the Lambda function with the access key ID and secret access key. Modify the Lambda function to use the environmental variables at run time during communication with Amazon S3
    - B. Generate an Amazon EC2 key pair. Store the private key in AWS Secrets Manager. Modify the Lambda function to retrieve the private key from Secrets Manager and to use the private key during communication with Amazon S3
    - C. Create an IAM role for the Lambda function. Attach an IAM policy that allows access to the S3 bucket
    - D. Create an IAM role for the Lambda function. Attach a bucket policy to the S3 bucket to allow access. Specify the function's IAM role as the principal
    - E. Create a security group. Attach the security group to the Lambda function. Attach a bucket policy that allows access to the S3 bucket through the security group ID

2. A security engineer is configuring a new website that is named example.com. The security engineer wants to secure communications with the website by requiring users to connect to example.com through HTTPS.
Which of the following is a valid option for storing SSL/TLS certificates?

    - A. Custom SSL certificate that is stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
    - B. Default SSL certificate that is stored in Amazon CloudFront
    - C. Custom SSL certificate that is stored in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
    - D. Default SSL certificate that is stored in Amazon S3

3. A security engineer needs to develop a process to investigate and respond to potential security events on a company's Amazon EC2 instances. All the EC2 instances are backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). The company uses AWS Systems Manager to manage all the EC2 instances and has installed Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) on all the EC2 instances.
The process that the security engineer is developing must comply with AWS security best practices and must meet the following requirements:
A compromised EC2 instance's volatile memory and non-volatile memory must be preserved for forensic purposes.
A compromised EC2 instance's metadata must be updated with corresponding incident ticket information.
A compromised EC2 instance must remain online during the investigation but must be isolated to prevent the spread of malware.
Any investigative activity during the collection of volatile data must be captured as part of the process.
Which combination of steps should the security engineer take to meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose three.)

    - A. Gather any relevant metadata for the compromised EC2 instance. Enable termination protection. Isolate the instance by updating the instance's security groups to restrict access. Detach the instance from any Auto Scaling groups that the instance is a member of. Deregister the instance from any Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) resources.
    - B. Gather any relevant metadata for the compromised EC2 instance. Enable termination protection. Move the instance to an isolation subnet that denies all source and destination traffic. Associate the instance with the subnet to restrict access. Detach the instance from any Auto Scaling groups that the instance is a member of. Deregister the instance from any Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) resources.
    - C. Use Systems Manager Run Command to invoke scripts that collect volatile data.
    - D. Establish a Linux SSH or Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session to the compromised EC2 instance to invoke scripts that collect volatile data.
    - E. Create a snapshot of the compromised EC2 instance's EBS volume for follow-up investigations. Tag the instance with any relevant metadata and incident ticket information.
    - F. Create a Systems Manager State Manager association to generate an EBS volume snapshot of the compromised EC2 instance. Tag the instance with any relevant metadata and incident ticket information.

4. A company has an organization in AWS Organizations. The company wants to use AWS CloudFormation StackSets in the organization to deploy various AWS design patterns into environments. These patterns consist of Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancers, Amazon RDS databases, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters or Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) clusters.
Currently, the companyâ€™s developers can create their own CloudFormation stacks to increase the overall speed of delivery. A centralized CI/CD pipeline in a shared services AWS account deploys each CloudFormation stack.
The company's security team has already provided requirements for each service in accordance with internal standards. If there are any resources that do not comply with the internal standards, the security team must receive notification to take appropriate action. The security team must implement a notification solution that gives developers the ability to maintain the same overall delivery speed that they currently have.
Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?

    - A. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the security team's email addresses to the SNS topic. Create a custom AWS Lambda function that will run the aws cloudformation validate-template AWS CLI command on all CloudFormation templates before the build stage in the CI/CD pipeline. Configure the CI/CD pipeline to publish a notification to the SNS topic if any issues are found.
    - B. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the security team's email addresses to the SNS topic. Create custom rules in CloudFormation Guard for each resource configuration. In the CI/CD pipeline, before the build stage, configure a Docker image to run the cfn-guard command on the CloudFormation template. Configure the CI/CD pipeline to publish a notification to the SNS topic if any issues are found.
    - C. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic and an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Subscribe the security team's email addresses to the SNS topic. Create an Amazon S3 bucket in the shared services AWS account. Include an event notification to publish to the SQS queue when new objects are added to the S3 bucket. Require the developers to put their CloudFormation templates in the S3 bucket. Launch EC2 instances that automatically scale based on the SQS queue depth. Configure the EC2 instances to use CloudFormation Guard to scan the templates and deploy the templates if there are no issues. Configure the CI/CD pipeline to publish a notification to the SNS topic if any issues are found.
    - D. Create a centralized CloudFormation stack set that includes a standard set of resources that the developers can deploy in each AWS account. Configure each CloudFormation template to meet the security requirements. For any new resources or configurations, update the CloudFormation template and send the template to the security team for review. When the review is completed, add the new CloudFormation stack to the repository for the developers to use.

5. A company is migrating one of its legacy systems from an on-premises data center to AWS. The application server will run on AWS, but the database must remain in the on-premises data center for compliance reasons. The database is sensitive to network latency. Additionally, the data that travels between the on-premises data center and AWS must have IPsec encryption.
Which combination of AWS solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

    - A. AWS Site-to-Site VPN
    - B. AWS Direct Connect
    - C. AWS VPN CloudHub
    - D. VPC peering
    - E. NAT gateway
